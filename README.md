# Show-List Project 

 
 

## Type the ID of the show you have watched to add to your list and then delete it when you are finished.  

 
 

I created this project to be able to help people make and keep track of shows that they are watching. When the user is done with the show or no longer wants to watch the show, they can delete the show off of their list.  

 
 

## Navigation 

 
 

Open the HTML in your browser. **Note that depending on the browser the code written might not work. ** You can do this by finding the file of the repository on your computer and double-clicking on the HTML or in your terminal you can open it by: 

 
 

```bash 

open -a "Google Chrome" index.html 

``` 

 
 

## Usage 

 
 

Now that you are on my app, you can see that it is very simple. It is comprising of a form and the box where the show will reside in. Inside the form you will place the ID of the show you would like to add to your list, then hit the *create new show name button*. The name of the show should appear below. You can input out as many shows as you please but when you are finish or you no longer want a show on your list for any reason just click on the **X** and it will be deleted.

## Contribution 

 
 

I just would like to thank the fellow students and teachers that helped me with my code. It was very much appreciated. I would also like to thank my friend who introduce me to this course for her help as well
