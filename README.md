# Show-List Project

## Type the ID of the show you have watched to add to your list and then delete it when you are finised. 

I created this project to be able to help people make and keep track of shows that they are watching. When the user is done with the show or no longer want to watch the show,  they are able to delete the show off their list. 

## Navigation

Open the HTML in your browser. **Note that depending on the browser the code written might not work.** You can do this by finding the file of the repository on your computer and double clicking ont he HTML or in you terminal you can open it by:

```bash
open -a "Google Chrome" index.html
```

## Usage

Now that you are on my app, you can see that it is very simple. It is comprises of a form and the box where the show will reside in. Inside the form you will place the ID of the show you will like to add to you list, then hit the *create new show name button*. The name of the show should appear bellow. You acn out as much shows as you please but when you are finish or you no longer want a show on your list for any reason just click on the **X** and it will be delete.
